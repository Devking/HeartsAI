# Hearts

## How To Run

**Using Command Line:**

1. Compile all of the source files by running `javac @sources.txt`
2. Run the Hearts program by running `java Hearts`

When adding your own source files, be sure to add them to `sources.txt` so that they will be compiled in step one.

**Using an IDE**

1. Compile all of the source files using your IDE
2. Run the compiled `Hearts` program using your IDE

## Implementing and Adding Your Own Agents

To implement your own AI agent, all you need to do is write a new class that extends `Player`. As an example, you can take a look at the existing classes such as `LookAheadPlayer` or `RandomPlayAI`.

Once they are implemented, you can add them to the game by modifying `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, or `p4` in `Hearts.java` to instantiate a new agent of your class.

## Implemented Players

- HumanPlayer: Allows humans to play Hearts
- LowPlayAI: Picks the lowest card in a valid suit
- RandomPlayAI: Plays a random card in a valid suit
- LookAheadPlayer: Looks ahead a minimal amount of steps to make a decision
- MCTSPlayer: Uses MCTS to decide on the optimal next move

## Class Structure

- Value enum
- Suit enum
- Card class (for each individual card)
- Deck class (for the "deck" to deal hands)
- Hand class (for each of the hands)
- Player abstract class (defines base functionality for any player)
- HumanPlayer class extends Player (`performAction()` allows human input)
- State class (track state of the game and allow for random playouts)
- Game class (plays one game)
- Hearts class (this is the main file that brings it all together)

0.6.0 &mdash;  Added a copy constructor for the Deck and began working on the State class
0.6.1 &mdash;  All Players now take parameters of the `State` class, State constructor now finished
0.6.2 &mdash;  Added functionality to return the range of cards in any given suit
0.6.3 &mdash;  **RandomPlayAI** has been implemented completely and is working
0.6.4 &mdash;  **MCTSPlayer** implementation has begun
0.6.5 &mdash;  **LookAheadPlayer** implementation has begun
0.7.0 &mdash;  Implementation for `advance()` within the State class has begun
0.7.1 &mdash;  `advance()` now checks for validity of the selected move
0.7.2 &mdash;  Design paradigm for multiple game playouts has been established
0.8.0 &mdash;  Finished preliminary version of `advance()` in the State class

1.0.1 &mdash;  Finished skeleton of MCTS Player
1.0.2 &mdash;  Fixed bug with `advance()` method in the State class with returning accrued points
1.0.3 &mdash;  Most MCTS functions have been written; just need to deal with random playouts
1.0.4 &mdash;  Debugging process for MCTS &mdash; fixed an issue with `treePolicy()`
1.0.5 &mdash;  All MCTS functions except `assignReward()` now are fully functional
1.0.6 &mdash;  Preliminary completion of `assignReward()` function
1.0.7 &mdash;  MCTS completed and running &mdash; checking for validity of results now
1.1.0 &mdash;  MCTS player completed (but not optimized) for now

### Future Work

1. Reorganize file structure
2. Add Ant build file
3. Create debug flags for running games without any output (except final win statistics)
4. Decouple Hand and Player operations by creating a new Hand class
5. Fix how cards are removed from the hand/selected by Players
